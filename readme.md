# Flow of Meaning - Junction 2018

_Creating meaningful interaction in Anonymous world._

Every day we stand in elevators passively.  We believe it's an opportunity for meaningful interaction.  By creating personalized icebreakers we start warm conversations.

Imagine. You are waiting for an elevator. When the door opens you see two strangers... You enter and as soon as the door closes you hear a voice, "Good Morning! How was dinner last night?".  The person standing next to you answers "My mama made me a lasange!". You realize "Hey, that is my favorite food!". We all long for building a better understanding of the people surrounding us, discovering our common interests and differences.  When you enter your office room you wear a big smile, because you just had a meaningful conversation. 

By utilizing VUI (Voice User Interface),  Interactive displays, motion detectors integrated with KONE APIs, we deliver better traveling experience in elevators.
